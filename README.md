# Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech Converter

This Python project combines speech recognition and text-to-speech functionality using the `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3` libraries. It listens to the user's speech through a microphone and converts it to text, which can then be used for further processing or converted back to speech.

## Features

- Speech Recognition: Converts spoken words into text using Google's speech recognition API.
- Microphone Input: Captures audio input directly from the microphone.
- Error Handling: Gracefully handles errors related to speech recognition.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pyttsx3 library
- SpeechRecognition library
- PyAudio (for microphone input)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdulMa1505/Speech-to-text-converter.git
   cd Speech-Recognition-TTS-Converter
